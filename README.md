# Quiz Website
# Started by creating an index.html for the layout and design of the quiz
# I created a seperate HTML that would be the page to display the highscores of the quiz
# Created Script.js with the different variables first 
# Var quiz data which contains list of quiz questions
# Vars for handling timer functionality 
# Added event listeners for both the start button and the view highscore button. 
# View highscore button will then lead to the highscore.html to display all highscores stored in local storage
# Function to start quiz with timer interval
# Created both "displayquestion" and "displayscores" functions
# Endgame function to stop timer and save scores in localstorage to be displayed when clicking view highscores
